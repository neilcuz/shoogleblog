  <h4>First things first, what does big data mean?</h4>
  
<p1>
Being a lazy person in February 2023 I of course asked ChatGPT this question. The response was extremely boring. So I asked it to spice it up a bit:
</p1>

<blockquote>
"Big data is the 21st century's gold rush! Imagine mountains of information waiting to be mined for hidden treasures, insights, and opportunities…”
</blockquote>

This rambling went on for quite a while so I threw in the towel and drew a handy chart instead, outlining the various levels of big data as I see them and how they relate to R (and Excel for good measure).

<br>
<ul>
  <li>Reproducibility is much stronger in R. Write your code and you have a detailed set of instructions of exactly what is happening. In Excel, calculations are buried in individual cells.
  </li>
  
  <li>It’s much easier to accidentally add a mistake in to Excel. Maybe you hardcode a value in a cell where a calculation should be when you are running your analysis. To run your script you just hit a button, no copy and paste required.
  </li>
  
  <li>You can tackle much more complex problems with R and often someone has already wrote the code for you built into R or in a package.
  </li>
</ul>

<pre>
  library(readr) # load the readr package
  data <- read_csv(“path-to-my-data/my-data.csv”)
</pre>
</body>
